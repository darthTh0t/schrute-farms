# Schrute Farms

A hotel booking page based on the characters of the US sitcome The Office. 
This page has been created with plain **HTML**, **CSS** & **vanilla Javacript** with the help of *SASS* preprocessor and
***BOOTSTRAP*** framework

As of now I have filled up paragraphs with Lorem Ipsum text, but as it gradaully evolves, I aim to fill up the details with 
SEO rich keywords to make it visible in Google search results.
